# ML and data apps with Streamlit
Building simple ML and data apps with Streamlit.

## See my article
See [my article on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-analytics-to-web-app-streamlit-made-easy-ed687266f0e8) on this topic.

## How to run the apps (scripts)

### First,

`pip install -U streamlit`

### Second, 
Make sure you also have other packages as featured in the scripts (the following list is not exhaustive),

- `Numpy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `Seaborn`

etc.

### Finally,
Open your terminal. Go to the folder/directory where these scripts reside. Then, run,

`streamlit run <script.py>`

where `<script.py>` must be replaced by the actual name of the Python script file.
